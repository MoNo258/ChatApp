<br />

## This project uses

* React Router
* Firebase authentication (email/password; Google; GitHub)
* Firebase realtime database

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
